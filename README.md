# CSCI 366 - Systems Programming

I completed this project for the CSCI 366 class at Montana State University, it is primarily written in C and it incorporates bit manipulation and networking in C.

I also learned a lot about testing in this project, as 90% of the project was graded using automated tests.

The code for the project is in /battlebit and some other homework that we completed during the semester is in the corresponding homework_n directories.
